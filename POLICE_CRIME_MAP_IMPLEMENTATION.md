## Technical Details

### Component Props

**`PoliceCrimeReportMap` Props:**
```typescript
interface PoliceCrimeReportMapProps {
  reportId: string;              // Crime report ID
  crimeLocation: {               // Location of the crime
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    address: string;
  };
  crimeType: string;             // Type of crime (used to detect SOS)
  reporterUid: string;           // UID of the reporter
  onClose: () => void;           // Close callback
}
```

### SOS Detection

SOS reports are automatically detected by checking if the crime type includes:
- "sos" (case-insensitive)
- "emergency" (case-insensitive)

Example: `"Emergency SOS"` ‚Üí Detected as SOS report

### Location Updates

- **Police locations**: Updated every 5 seconds (real-time tracking)
- **Crime location**: Static (captured at time of report)
- **Civilian location for SOS**: Uses the crime report location (SOS captures user's location at alert time)

## Database Requirements

### Police Account Structure

Police officers must have `currentLocation` in their database profile:

```json
{
  "police": {
    "police account": {
      "{userId}": {
        "email": "officer@police.gov",
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "badgeNumber": "12345",
        "currentLocation": {
          "latitude": 14.5995,
          "longitude": 120.9842,
          "lastUpdated": "2025-10-10T10:00:00.000Z"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Crime Report Structure

SOS reports are identified by their `crimeType`:

```json
{
  "crimeType": "Emergency SOS",
  "severity": "Immediate",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 14.5995,
    "longitude": 120.9842,
    "address": "123 Main St, City"
  },
  "reporterUid": "civilian_user_id"
}
```
