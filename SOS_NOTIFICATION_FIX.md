# SOS Notification Fix Guide

## Problem
- ✅ SOS alerts appear in app's notification tab
- ❌ No push notification banner on device
- ❌ No system notification when app is in background/closed

## Root Cause
The issue is that **notification channels** are not properly created on Android. Without proper notification channels, FCM notifications won't display as system notifications.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Notification Channel Manager
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/java/com/mobileapp/NotificationChannelManager.java`
- **Purpose**: Creates Android notification channels programmatically
- **Channels Created**:
  - `e-responde-notifications` (default, orange color)
  - `e-responde-sos` (SOS alerts, red color, bypasses Do Not Disturb)

### 2. Updated MainApplication.kt
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/java/com/mobileapp/MainApplication.kt`
- **Change**: Added `NotificationChannelManager.createNotificationChannels(this)` in `onCreate()`
- **Purpose**: Ensures channels are created when app starts

### 3. Enhanced Cloud Function
- **File**: `functions/index.js`
- **Enhancement**: SOS notifications use `e-responde-sos` channel with red color
- **Features**: High priority, vibration, red LED light

### 4. Updated AndroidManifest.xml
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- **Added**: SOS notification channel metadata
- **Purpose**: Provides fallback channel configuration

## Testing Steps

### 1. Rebuild the App
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
npx react-native run-android
```

### 2. Test SOS Notifications
1. **Foreground Test**: App open → Should see logs + emergency sound
2. **Background Test**: App minimized → Should see red notification banner
3. **Closed Test**: App force-closed → Should see red notification banner

### 3. Check Device Settings
- Settings > Apps > E-Responde > Notifications
- Verify both channels exist:
  - "E-Responde Notifications" (default)
  - "SOS Emergency Alerts" (SOS)

### 4. Debug Commands
```bash
# Test SOS notification flow
node test-sos-notifications.js

# Debug notification visibility
node debug-sos-push-notifications.js
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Foreground (App Open)
- Console logs showing FCM message received
- Emergency sound played
- No system notification banner (this is correct)

### ✅ Background (App Minimized)
- Red notification banner appears
- Vibration pattern: [0, 250, 250, 250]
- Red LED light blinking (on supported devices)
- Emergency sound

### ✅ Closed (App Force-Closed)
- Red notification banner appears
- Vibration pattern: [0, 250, 250, 250]
- Red LED light blinking
- Emergency sound
- Tapping notification opens app

## Troubleshooting

### If Still No Push Notifications:

1. **Check Notification Channels**:
   - Settings > Apps > E-Responde > Notifications
   - Both channels should be enabled
   - Check if "SOS Emergency Alerts" channel exists

2. **Check FCM Token**:
   - Firebase Console > Firestore > users collection
   - Verify user has `fcmToken` field
   - Check if token is recent

3. **Check Device Settings**:
   - Do Not Disturb is off
   - Battery optimization is not blocking notifications
   - App has notification permissions

4. **Check Firebase Console**:
   - Functions > Logs
   - Look for Cloud Function execution logs
   - Check for FCM token errors

## Files Modified

1. `android/app/src/main/java/com/mobileapp/NotificationChannelManager.java` (NEW)
2. `android/app/src/main/java/com/mobileapp/MainApplication.kt` (UPDATED)
3. `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (UPDATED)
4. `functions/index.js` (UPDATED)
5. `services/fcmService.ts` (UPDATED)

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the app** with the new notification channel setup
2. **Test SOS notifications** in different app states
3. **Verify notification channels** exist in device settings
4. **Check Firebase Console** for Cloud Function logs

The notification channels are now properly configured, so SOS notifications should work the same way as regular notifications but with enhanced emergency features!
