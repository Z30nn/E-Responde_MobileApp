─────────────────────────      ──────────────────
Only user's reports           ALL reports

## 🎓 How It Works (Technical)

### Authentication Flow

```typescript
// User enters email and password
const email = "officer@police.gov";
const password = "password123";

// System checks if email is police
const isPolice = await FirebaseService.isPoliceEmail(email);

if (isPolice) {
  // Login as police (no email verification)
  const userCred = await FirebaseService.loginPolice({ email, password });
  // → Redirects to Police Dashboard
} else {
  // Login as civilian (with email verification)
  const userCred = await FirebaseService.loginCivilian({ email, password });
  if (!userCred.user.emailVerified) {
    // → Show verification screen
  }
  // → Redirects to Civilian Dashboard
}
```

### Map Location Fetching

```typescript
// Every 5 seconds
const policeUsers = await FirebaseService.getAllPoliceLocations();

// Returns:
[
  {
    uid: "abc123",
    email: "officer@police.gov",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Smith",
    badgeNumber: "12345",
    currentLocation: {
      latitude: 14.5995,
      longitude: 120.9842,
      lastUpdated: "2025-10-10T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
]

// Display on map as markers
```
