# VoIP Call Buttons Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Added VoIP Call Functionality

### What Was Added

I've integrated VoIP call initiation buttons into the `CrimeReportDetail.tsx` screen. Now both civilians and police officers can initiate voice calls directly from the crime report details.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Civilian User - Call Assigned Officer**
**Button:** "📞 Call Assigned Officer"

**When it appears:**
- Only on the civilian's own crime reports
- Only when a police officer has been assigned (`respondingOfficerId` exists)

**What it does:**
- Initiates a voice call to the assigned police officer
- Shows the call screen with officer's name
- Allows real-time voice communication

### 2. **Police User - Call Civilian Reporter**
**Button:** "📞 Call Civilian Reporter"

**When it appears:**
- Only on the police view of crime reports
- Only for non-anonymous reports

**What it does:**
- Initiates a voice call to the civilian who reported the crime
- Shows the call screen with civilian's name
- Allows real-time voice communication

**Protection:** Cannot call anonymous reporters

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No officer assigned" error
- **Cause:** No police officer has responded to the report yet
- **Solution:** Have a police officer click "Respond to Report" first

### "Cannot call anonymous reporters" error
- **Cause:** Trying to call a civilian who filed an anonymous report
- **Solution:** This is intentional for privacy protection

### Call button not appearing (Civilian)
- Check if you're viewing your own report
- Check if an officer is assigned to the report
- Check if you're logged in

### Call button not appearing (Police)
- Check if you're in police view (isPoliceView=true)
- Check if report is not anonymous
- Check if you're logged in

### Microphone permission denied
- Go to device Settings → Apps → E-Responde → Permissions
- Enable Microphone permission
- Restart the app
